# Programming Hardware Accelerators

This is a collection of information and resources on programming [hardware
accelerators](./src/hardware-accelerators.md).

My goal is to accumulate knowledge on choosing and programming hardware
accelerators and to share that knowledge with the wider community. Contributions
are welcome.

## Target Audience

If you're working with hardware accelerators or considering using one in a
project, this book is right for you. It is primarily targeted at software
developers and architects in compute intensive environments where the use of
hardware accelerators can help to speed up a workload or reduce the
computational load on a server.

A minimal background in computer science is necessary to understand the book's
concepts and examples.
