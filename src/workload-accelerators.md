# Introduction

Most workloads have reasonable performance when running on general purpose CPUs
but some workloads could run faster on specialized processing units called
accelerators. Accelerators can range from small co-processors to PCIe attached
devices and even to GPUs.

While using an accelerator can lead to workload improvements, care must be taken
to select the most suitable accelerator for the workload. Using an accelerator
may also require special programming models.

## Workload Accelerator

A workload accelerator is a hardware or software solution designed to enhance
the performance of specific tasks or workloads, such as data processing,
cryptography, rendering, or machine learning. These accelerators can include
specialized processors, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), FPGAs
(Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), or dedicated software algorithms optimized for
particular tasks. They help improve efficiency and speed up the execution of
complex computations, often used in data centers, scientific research, and
high-performance computing environments.

### Workload accelerator properties

1. **Parallel Processing Capability**: Workload accelerators often excel in
   parallel processing, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
   This parallelism enables them to handle complex computations more
   efficiently, leading to significant speedups compared to traditional
   sequential processing.
2. **Specialized Architecture**: Unlike general-purpose CPUs, workload
   accelerators are designed with specialized architectures optimized for
   specific tasks or workloads. These architectures may include custom hardware
   components, such as tensor cores for deep learning or specialized
   instructions for encryption and decryption.
3. **High Throughput and Performance**: Workload accelerators are engineered to
   deliver high throughput and performance for targeted workloads. By offloading
   intensive computations from the CPU to dedicated accelerators, overall system
   performance can be greatly enhanced, enabling faster execution of tasks and
   improved responsiveness.
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Many workload accelerators are optimized for energy
   efficiency, aiming to maximize performance per watt. By efficiently utilizing
   resources and minimizing power consumption, these accelerators help reduce
   energy costs and environmental impact, making them attractive options for
   data centers and mobile devices.
5. **Programmability and Flexibility**: While some workload accelerators have
   fixed functionalities tailored to specific tasks, others offer
   programmability and flexibility to support a wider range of applications.
   Programmable accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs, allow developers to
   customize algorithms and adapt to evolving workload requirements, enhancing
   versatility and scalability.
